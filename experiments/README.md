## Steps to reproduce results
To reconstruct results from the paper (liaw2024) run the scripts in the following order as shown below.

**Note**: 
- The following feature selection methods are implemented in Matlab:
  - IRelief [(Sun et al., 2010)][IRlf]
  - LHR [(Cai et al., 2014)][LHR]
  - mRMR [(Ding and Peng, 2003)][mRMR]

- All the scripts require modifications to the paths of corresponding input files, either as input arguments or hard-coded in the scripts 

## Results from synthetic dataset
### Electrical datasets
**Step 0**

Generate the datasets by runing the script (code adapted from paper by [Kamalov et al., 2022][syntElectrical]):
```
python3 synthetic/Electrical/generate_artificialdatasets.py
```

This will produce four Python-pickled binary files:
- ANDOR continuous datasets
- ADDER continuous datasets
- ANDOR discrete datasets
- ADDER discrete datasets

Generated datasets might show random variations due to how computers handle randomness. For an exact reproduction, use the datasets in Electrical-Datasets.zip

**Step 1**

Create a folder for each of the datasets above, each with the following subfolders:
-  PDE-S
-  OtherFS
-  IRelief
-  LHRelief
-  mRMR
-  Combined

---
Now, for each dataset carry out **Steps 2-5** ... 

**Step 2**

Carry out feature selection with PDE-Segregate:
```  
python3 synthetic/Electrical/PDE-S_Electrical.py
```

Save the output files in the PDE-S subfolder made in **Step 0**.

**Step 3**

Carry out feature selection with other feature selection methods implemented in Python:
```  
python3 synthetic/Electrical/featureSelection_Electrical.py
```

Save the output files in the OtherFS subfolder made in **Step 0**.

Also carry out feature selection with methods implemented in Matlab:
- synthetic/matlabFS/featureSelection_Electrical.m (I-Relief and LHR)
- synthetic/matlabFS/featureSelection_mRMR_Electrical.m (mRMR for continuous electrical datasets)
- synthetic/matlabFS/featureSelection_mRMR_ElectricalDiscrete.m (mRMR for discrete electrical datasets)

Save the corresponding output files in the IRelief, LHRelief, and mRMR subfolders made in **Step 0**.

**Step 4**

Carry out preprocessing step to combine feature selection results from the different scripts.
```
python3 synthetic/Electrical/combine_fss.py
```

**Step 5**

Evaluations
- Success rates according to [Bolón-Canedo et al., 2013][SucRate]
  ```
  python3 synthetic/Electrical/evaluate_fss.py
  ```
- Classification accuracy via 10-fold stratified cross-validation
  ```
  python3 synthetic/Electrical/PDE-S_10stratifiedcv.py
  python3 synthetic/Electrical/10stratifiedcv.py
  ```

### SD datasets
**Step 0**

The SD datasets are generated according to the method proposed by (paper). The synthetic datasets are also available at (...). However, for a more accurate reproduction, unzip the compressed folder SD-Datasets.zip to use the datasets used in our paper, which have been preprocessed to better suit our "style".

**Step 1**

Carry out feature selection with PDE-Segregate:
```  
python3 synthetic/SDI/PDE-S_SDI.py
```

**Step 2**

Carry out feature selection with other feature selection methods implemented in Python:
```  
python3 synthetic/SDI/featureSelection_SDI.py
```

Also carry out feature selection with methods implemented in Matlab:
- synthetic/matlabFS/featureSelection_SDI.m (I-Relief and LHR)
- synthetic/matlabFS/featureSelection_mRMR_SDI.m (mRMR)

**Step 3**
